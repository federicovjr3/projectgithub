    <p>the first ever instance of the belief of mathetics and how it intersects  with  images is one pythogreas. specifically with his use of relating the golden ratio. The golden ratio is a ratio( how much one number can contain another),  in which  the ratio of the sum is larger  then  both of the  two quantities.  it has popped up throughout imagery as a whole. symmetric modulation( splitting a image up to send through a medium) is very efficient, and uses the golden ratio as the way to cut up images.</p>
